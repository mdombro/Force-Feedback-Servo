# Force Feedback Servo

An Arduino library to add force feedback to RC servos. With some additional hardware to measure the force applied to a servo arm, the Force Feedback Servo library will move a servo (or servos and multiple force sensors) in response to the measured force(s). 

The main application of this library is to allow the development of a RC plane control system that gives realtime force-feeback to the pilot's control joystick - to give the effect of flying an actual airplane.
